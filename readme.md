This is Jose's Utility for Data Exploration. `jude` is a work in progress, and I might abandon it after a while. This library attempts to be a general resource for analyzing different types of data. For the time being, most of my work is focused on time-series in the format provided by Toptica's wavemeter (WS8). In the future, as my scientific needs change, I will add more features and scripts for new formats.
